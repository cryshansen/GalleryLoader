# GalleryLoader
An image Gallery java app that reads a specified folder for images, sends a json string of filenames and outputs to browser  masonry layout design of images with a lazy loader integration. I believe there is a bug for where the position block gets called via length of images because it is in the wrong place. It works however. :)
